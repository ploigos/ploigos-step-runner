"""`StepImplementer` for the `container-image-static-vulnerability-scan` step using OpenSCAP.

Convenience wrapper for the `OpenSCAPGeneric` step implementer so that users
can specify `OpenSCAP` for the `container-image-static-compliance-scan`.

Step Configuration
------------------
Step configuration expected as input to this step.
Could come from:

  * static configuration
  * runtime configuration
  * previous step results
